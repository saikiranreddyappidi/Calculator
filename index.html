            <h2>App Description and User Manual</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This calculator app is designed to perform both basic arithmetic and advanced logical operations, making it a versatile tool for everyday use and specialized tasks. The intuitive interface ensures that users can quickly perform calculations and manage their history with ease.</p>

            <h3>Main Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Arithmetic Operations:</strong> Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Results:</strong> As users type numbers and operators, the app dynamically displays the results based on the current input.</li>
                <li><strong>History Management:</strong> All completed equations are saved to the history, accessible by pressing the "HISTORY" button.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Operations:</strong> Toggle between arithmetic and logical operations using the 'B' button. Logical operators include OR (|), AND (&), XOR (^), and NOT (~). Note that logical operations ignore decimal parts.</li>
                <li><strong>Percentage Calculation:</strong> A dedicated % button allows for easy percentage calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>History Interaction:</strong> Users can copy, share, delete individual entries, or select all history items for batch actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Users can clear their entire calculation history using the delete button at the bottom right corner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <p>When you open the calculator app, you will see a numpad with basic operators (+, -, *, /) and the equals sign (=). As you start typing numbers, the app immediately shows the results of the arithmetic operations based on your input. Pressing the equals sign (=) will save the current equation to the history.</p>
            <p>At the bottom left corner, there's a button with the symbol 'B'. Pressing this button toggles the operators to logical operators: OR (|), AND (&), XOR (^), and NOT (~). These operators perform logical operations on the given input values, ignoring any decimal parts. Arithmetic operations, however, will consider floating numbers.</p>
            <p>At the top of the screen, there are options like "HISTORY," "MORE," and "FINANCE." The "HISTORY" option lets you view all your previous calculations. The "MORE" and "FINANCE" options are still in beta versions.</p>
            <p>In the history view, you can long-press any expression to see options like copy, share, delete, and select all. You can copy an expression, share it through apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, or Messenger, delete a specific expression, or select all expressions for batch actions. There's also a delete button at the bottom right corner to clear all history entries.</p>
